# CeasarCipher
Encrypt and decrypts a line of text using the ceasar cipher, also made a GUI for it. 

Gui is kind of jank, and does not have any built functions. Working on learning more about tkinter before working on it some more.

10/15/2019: Updated the GUI. I think this is what I actually want it to look like. Will add brute force method in a second tab at a later date.

10/20/2019: 
Changed gui layout.  
Added log frame and widget to show transcription of users message.  
Added label to scale, and shows the value of the key according to scale position.  
Created get_message() and get_scale functions().  
get_message() shows value of users message to the shell.  
get_scale() shows value of scale to the shell.  
Created a bind for return key for get_message() function. 

TODO:

Map ceasarcipher.py functions to gui.  
Create class structure for GUI.  
Add brute for message to another tab within the program.
