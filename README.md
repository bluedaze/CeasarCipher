# CeasarCipher
Encrypt and decrypts a line of text using the ceasar cipher, also made a GUI for it. 

Gui is kind of jank, and does not have any built functions. Working on learning more about tkinter before working on it some more.

10/15/2019: Updated the GUI. I think this is what I actually want it to look like. Will add brute force method in a second tab at a later date.
